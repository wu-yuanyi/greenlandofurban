1.This software is applied to the integrated effectiveness evaluation of greenland of built-up area
2.Evaluation put the administrative unit as the basic unit.
3.The software consists of four modules: B1(ecological efficiency evaluation moudle), B2(economic effiency evaluation moudle), B3(social effectiveness evaluation moudle), B4(comprehensive efficiency evaluation moudle)

Urban Green Space comprehensive efficiency = X1 * (Urban Green Space ecological efficiency) + X2 * (Urban Green Space economical efficiency) + X3 * (Urban Green Space social efficiency)

X1,X2,X3 are the weight of those three variables. They are often generated by AHP algorithm, the defaults is 0.4, 0.25,0.35. It also can be inputed bu users.

#ecological efficiency evaluation moudle
B1: value of urban green space ecological efficiency
C1: value of maintaining carbon and oxygen balance
C2: value of ease air pollution
C3: value of storing and conserving water
C4: value of adjusting the climate

C1 = (S  \*Qc \*Tc + S \* Qo2 \* Po2) / 10000
S(unit is hm2):the area of greenland in the researched location
Qc:(0.625t/(hm2 \* a))
Tc: Carbon tax (1024.125 RMB/t)
Qo2(1.667 t /(hm2 \* a))
Po2:price of industrial oxygen [650RMB/t]

C2 = S \* Q污染物 \* Ft / 10000

Ft:

C3 = R\*（P-E-C \*P）\*S/1000
