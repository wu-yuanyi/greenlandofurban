#introduction#
1. This software is applied to the integrated effectiveness evaluation of greenland of built-up area
2. Evaluation put the administrative unit as the basic unit.
3. The software consists of four modules:
- B1(ecological efficiency evaluation moudle), 
- B2(economic effiency evaluation moudle), 
- B3(social effectiveness evaluation moudle), 
- B4(comprehensive efficiency evaluation moudle).

**Urban Green Space comprehensive efficiency = X1 * (Urban Green Space ecological efficiency) + X2 * (Urban Green Space economical efficiency) + X3 * (Urban Green Space social efficiency)**

*X1,X2,X3 are the weight of those three variables. They are often generated by AHP algorithm, the defaults is 0.4, 0.25,0.35. It also can be inputed bu users.*

##ecological efficiency evaluation moudle##
###B1 = C1 + C2 + C3###

- B1: value of urban green space ecological efficiency.
- C1: value of maintaining carbon and oxygen balance.
- C2: value of ease air pollution.
- C3: value of storing and conserving water.
- C4: value of adjusting the climate.


###C1 = ( S  * Qc * Tc + S * Qo2 * Po2 ) / 10000###

- S: the area of greenland in the researched location, unit is m^2.
- Qc: sequestration of unit area of greenland per year, default value is 0.625t/hm^2.
- Tc: Carbon tax, default value is 1024.125 RMB/t.
- Qo2: oxygen release of unit area of greenland per year, default value is 1.667 t/hm^2.
- Po2: price of industrial oxygen, default value is 650RMB/t.

###C2 = S * Q * Ft / 10000###
- S: the area of greenland in the researched location, unit is m^2.
- Q: unit area of greenland's ability of absorbing polluants per year.
- Ft: fee of  pollution administration.

|| *coniferous forest* || *0.018*|| *0.18* || *33.2* ||
|| *Mixed conifer and broadleaf* || *0.152* || *0.263* || *21.65* ||
|| *broadleaf forest type* || *0.087* || *0.345* || *10.11* ||

|| *polluants* || *fee of administration(RMB/t)* ||
|| *SO2* || *600* ||
|| *NOx* || *420* ||
|| *dust* || *170* ||

###C3 = R * ( P - E - C * P ) * S / 1000###
- S: the area of greenland in the researched location, unit is m^2.
- R: the price of residential water， default value is 4RMB/t.
- P: annual rainfall, default value is 1317.3mm.
- E: annual evaporation， default value is 697.44mm.
- C: runoff coefficient, default value is 0.2.

###C4 = S * T * W * p * t###
- S: the area of greenland in the researched location, unit is m^2.
- T: cooling degree of unit area of greenland, default value is 0.038℃/ m2
- W: air-conditioning power consumption per hour，default value is 0.012 KWh
- P: residential electricity prices, default value is 0.462RMB/KWh
- t: averaged consumption time of air-condition per year
